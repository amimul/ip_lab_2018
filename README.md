## Installation

For these labs we'll need [git][git_link], [Python][python_link], [OpenCV][opencv_link] and the basic [scientific packages][scipy]. If you don't know how to install those on your platform, we recommend to install [Anaconda][anaconda], a distribution of the [conda][conda] package and environment manager. Please follow the below instructions to install it.

1. Go to https://www.anaconda.com/download and download the Python 3.x installer for platform (*i.e. Windows, macOS, or Linux*).
2. Install with default options.
3. Open the Anaconda Prompt (e.g. from the Windows Start menu), or the Terminal for *macOS* and *Linux* users.
4. Install git with `conda install git`.
5. Insall opencv with `pip install opencv-contrib-python`
6. Download this repository with the following command `git clone https://github.com/ChristopheEcabert/ip_lab_2018`
7. Start Jupyter with `jupyter notebook`. The command should open a new tab in your web browser.
8. Edit and run the notebooks from your browser.
