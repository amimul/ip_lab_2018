    "In this section, we will learn the basic workflow of using TensorFlow with a simple linear model and multilayer perceptron model, respectively. In the previous part, we got familiar with the basic logistic classifier using (LogisticRegression or LogisticRegressionCv). You won't suffer from using the logistic classifier. But, you can obviously see the performance efficiency while using the deep neural network classifier.\n",

    "In the last couple of years, deep learning has produced state-of-the-art results in many computer vision tasks. In this section, a practical overview of deep Learning's basic concepts has been provided and we are going to work with a simple linear and multi-layer perceptron (MLP) models.\n",
    "\n",
    "At its core, deep learning is a class of neural network models. That is a model with an input layer, an output layer, and an arbitrary number of hidden layers. These layers are made up of neurons or neural units. They are called neurons because they share some similarities with the behaviour of the neurons present in the human brain. For our purposes, we can think of a neuron as a nonlinear function of the weighted sum of its inputs. Since the neuron is really the most basic part of any deep learning model it is a good place to start. \n",

    "Once the TensorFlow graph has been created, we have to create a TensorFlow session which is used to execute the graph and train our model. For this, we enter a session environment using a `tf.Session` as a context manager. We pass our graph  object to its constructor, so that it knows which graph to manage. To then execute nodes, we have several options. The   most general way is to call Session.run() and pass a list of tensors we wish to compute. Alternatively, we may call `eval()` on  tensors and `run()` on  operations directly.\n",
